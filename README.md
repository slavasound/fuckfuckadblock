### Disclaimer
#### Adguard

This list uses scriptlets, some products from Adguard, for example Adguard for Windows, do not yet support scriptlets, if you want to use this sheet, then I recommend you to use the Adguard extension.

#### Adblock Plus

Since Adblock Plus has functional limitations, it cannot be supported.
